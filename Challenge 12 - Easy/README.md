# Spare Server Capacity

Data Lemur SQL challenge to find the total monthly unused server capacity by data center.

## Problem

Microsoft Azure's capacity planning team wants to understand how much data its customers are using, and how much spare capacity is left in each of it's data centers. Youâ€™re given three tables: customers, datacenters, and forecasted_demand.

Write a query to find the total monthly unused server capacity for each data center. Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.

## Solution

This one was slightly tricky. A simple join would've meant that capacity was being overestimated. Instead, we needed a subquery to total all the demand by datacenter and then join. After that, it was about taking the capacity/demand difference and voilla.

The official solution tackles the problem similarly with the exception of using a CTE instead of a subquery.
