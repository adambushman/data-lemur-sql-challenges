# Average Post Hiatus Part 1

Data Lemur SQL challenge to find the number of days between first and last post of the year 2021.

## Problem

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

## Solution

My first thought was a CTE and some joins to separate first and last, but then I remembered that simple "max" and "min" functions grouped by the user would suffice. After that we needed only implement a "where" clause to filter for the year and a "having" clause to ensure we had 2 or more posts.

The official solution approached the problem the exact same.
