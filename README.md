# Data Lemur SQL Challenges

Completed SQL challenges from Data Lemur, an interactive SQL resource by Nick Singh

## Description

SQL is the foundational skill for data folk. Every activity, be it an ETL process, model, test, or visualization requires data from the source to begin.
I aim to improve my SQL skills by completing the challenges from Data Lemur that range in difficulty, industry, and techniques.

Data Lemur has over 50 challenges as I'm beginning this project. The challenges derive from widely known tech companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla, Twitter, 
Amazon, PayPal, and more. The challenges fascilitate practice of data type conversion, aggregations, array functions, window functions, and much, much more.

## Understanding this Repository

I've created a folder for each challenge, labeled in the order they appear on Data Lemur and the difficulty rating. Within each folder, you'll find a README file describing the problem, solution, and a link to the challenge. You'll also find a .sql file with my solution and comments about the approach.
