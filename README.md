# Data Lemur SQL Challenges

Completed SQL challenges from Data Lemur, an interactive SQL resource by Nick Singh

## Description

SQL is the foundational skill for data folk. Every activity, be it an ETL process, model, test, or visualization requires data from the source to begin.
I aim to improve my SQL skills by completing the challenges from Data Lemur that range in difficulty, industry, and techniques.

Data Lemur has over 50 challenges as I'm beginning this project. The challenges derive from widely known tech companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla, Twitter, 
Amazon, PayPal, and more. The challenges fascilitate practice of data type conversion, aggregations, array functions, window functions, and much, much more.

## Results

I've completed all 54 free challenges offered by DataLemur. 

I was able to practice novice to advanced techniques, specifically developing great intuition and application of window functions and CTEs. Data Lemur tagged most of the challenges and you can see the frequency techniques practiced in these challenges.

I am so impressed with how the structure of my queries improved to enhance readability and efficiency. I feel far more equipped with the available techniques and features of SQL to solve data transformation and extraction problems.
